# Spotify - Exploratory Data Analysis
---
## Background
This is my first data analytics project, an exploratory data analysis of song data from 1922 to 2021. This comes from a Kaggle dataset compiled by Yamac Eren Ay, who scraped data of around 600,000 songs from the Spotify Web API. My music playlists include songs from several different eras, so I decided to analyze trends between different time periods to see how music has evolved over the last few decades and what genres have gained or lost popularity.
